Q2. A City Bus is a Ring Route Bus which runs in circular fashion. That is, the Bus once started at Source Bus Stop, halts at each Bus Stop in its Route and at the end it reaches to Source Bus stop again. If there are n number of Stops and if bus starts at Bus Stop number 1, then after nth Bus Stop, the next stop in the Route will be Bus Stop number1 always. If there are n stops, there will be n paths. One path connects 2 stops. Distances (in meters) for all paths in Ring Route is given in array Path[] as below. Path = [800, 600, 750, 900, 1400, 1200, 1100, 1500] Fare is determined based on the distance covered from source to destination stop as Distance d between Input Source and Destination Stops can be measured by looking at values in array Path[] and fare can be calculated as per following criteria: - If d = 1000 meters, then fare= 5 INR - (When calculating fare for other distances, the calculated fare containing any fraction value should be ceiled. For example, for distance 900, when fare initially calculated is 4.5 which must be ceiled to 5) Path is circular in function. Value at each index indicate distance till current stop from previous one. And each index positions can be mapped with values at same index in Busstops[] array, which is a string array holding abbreviation of names for all stops as "THANERAILWAYSTN'= "TH", "GAONDEVI"="GA", "ICEFACTROY"="IC") "HARINIWASCIRCLE"="HA", "TEENHATHNAKA"="TE", "LUISWADI"="LU", "NITINCOMPANYJUNCTION"="NI", "CADBURRYJUNCTION"="CA‚Äù
Given, n=8, where n is number of total Bus Stops. Bus Stops =["TH", "GA", "IC", "HA", "TE", "LU", "NI", "CA"). Write a code with function getFare(String Source, String Destination) which takes Input as source and destination stops(in the format containing first 2 characters of Name of the Busstop) and calculate and return travel fare.
Example 1:
Input Values
ca
Ca
Output Values
INVALID INPUT
Example 2:
Input Values
NI
HA
Output Values
23.0 INR
Note: Input and Output should be in format given in example.
Input should not be case sensitive and output should be in the format <FLOAT> INR.
